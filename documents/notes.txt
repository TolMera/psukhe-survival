pf-perlin
https://www.npmjs.com/package/pf-perlin
Perlin noise tool - looks pretty good, thought it will need tuning to be appropriate for the task.
Test script:
let Perlin = require('pf-perlin')
let map = new Perlin({
    seed: `ludumDare44`,
    dimensions: 2,
    min: 0,
    max: 1,
    wavelength: 1,
    octaves: 1,
    octaveScale: 0.5,
    persistence: 0.5,
    //interpolation: ,
})
let min = 1;
let max = -1;
for (let x = 0; x < 1; x += 1/1024) {
    let v = map.get([x,0]);
    if (v < min) min = v;
    if (v > max) max = v;
}
console.log(min, max);
delete(Perlin);
delete(map);
delete(min);
delete(max);
